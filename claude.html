          Artificial Intelligence

          <p class="mb-4">
            Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by
            machines, as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals
            including humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study
            of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its
            environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving
            its goals.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 wiki-title">History</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the
            campus of Dartmouth College during the summer of 1956. Those who
            attended would become the leaders of AI research for decades. Many
            of them predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human would
            exist in no more than a generation, and they were given millions of
            dollars to make this vision come true.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 wiki-title">Applications</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            AI has been used in a wide range of fields including medical
            diagnosis, stock trading, robot control, law, scientific discovery
            and toys. However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A
            lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often
            without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough
            and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."

            Machine Learning
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that
            improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a part of
            artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model
            based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make
            predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do
            so.

            Natural Language Processing
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics,
            computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the
            interactions between computers and human language, in particular how
            to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural
            language data.
